	<h1>The Wizard of Oz</h1>
	<h2>L. Frank Baum</h2>
	<p>"Then I shall never have courage," declared the Lion.</p>
	<p>"And I shall never have brains," added the Scarecrow.</p>
	<p>"And I shall never have a heart," spoke the Tin Woodman.</p>
	<p>"And I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry," said Dorothy, beginning to cry.</p>
	<p>"Be careful!" cried the green girl. "The tears will fall on your green silk gown and spot it."</p>
	<p>So Dorothy dried her eyes and said, "I suppose we must try it; but I am sure I do not want to kill anybody, even to see
		Aunt Em again."</p>
