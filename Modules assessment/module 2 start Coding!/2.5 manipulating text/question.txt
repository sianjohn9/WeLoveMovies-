Diego wants his fans to be able to search for any of his songs. For a search to work, you need to compare a user's input with song titles in Diego's albums.

Read the instructions below to understand the request and requirements necessary for you to successfully complete this challenge.

Remember, you have all the skills needed to do this. But if you need support, please reach out for help!

Click on the Web Preview. Notice the search bar. Type Seen a Thousand Things into the search bar and then click Submit. Notice the error message that comes up. You want the search to find the lyrics for the songs Seen a Thousand Things and We're All Light.

Click the script.js file and follow the instructions to use string methods to make the search work properly.

Use the Web Preview to test the effects of your updates in the script.js file and verify that the search feature is working correctly. To test, first input Seen a Thousand Things and click Submit. It should take you to the lyrics page for Seen a Thousand Things. Click the Diego music logo to get back to the home page. After getting the search to work for Seen a Thousand Things, do the same for We're All Light.

Click on Run Tests when you think you've got a solution. When the tests pass (you'll know because they'll turn green), go ahead and submit the challenge. Then, congratulate yourself for finishing!
