Take-home: Science questions
Part 1: Count correct answers
In this four-part challenge, you'll write functions to grade students' answers to a science quiz.

This is part 1. In this challenge, you'll write a function to count the number of answers that are correct.

Read these instructions.
Write the code to solve this challenge.
Run the tests to check your answer.
After your code passes the tests, move to the next challenge.
Instructions
Write a function named countCorrectAnswers that does the following:

Takes in an array of student answers
Returns the number of answers that have isCorrect set to true
Using the example answers below,

countCorrectAnswers(answers); //=> 3
If none of the responses are correct, return 0.

Example quiz data
A student's answers to a quiz are represented as an array.

let answers = [
  {
    question: 'What is the phase where chromosomes line up in mitosis?',
    response: 'Metaphase',
    isCorrect: true,
    isEssayQuestion: false
  },
  {
    question: 'What anatomical structure connects the stomach to the mouth?',
    response: 'Esophagus',
    isCorrect: true,
    isEssayQuestion: false
  },
  {
    question: 'What are lysosomes?',
    response: 'A lysosome is a membrane-bound organelle found in many animal cells. They are spherical vesicles that contain hydrolytic enzymes that can break down many kinds of biomolecules.',
    isCorrect: true,
    isEssayQuestion: true
  },
  {
    question: 'True or False: Prostaglandins can only constrict blood vessels.',
    response: 'True',
    isCorrect: false,
    isEssayQuestion: false
  }
];
Note: The tests will pass different arrays into your functionâ€”not just this one. The arrays will be like this one. Each item will be an object with the keys question, response, isCorrect, and isEssayQuestio
