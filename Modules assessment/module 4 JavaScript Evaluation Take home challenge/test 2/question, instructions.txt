Take-home: School shopping
Part 2: Most expensive item
This is part 2. In this challenge, you'll write a function to find the name of the most expensive item in a shopping cart.

Read these instructions.
Write the code to solve this challenge.
Run the tests to check your answer.
After your code passes the tests, move to the next challenge.
Instructions
Create a function named mostExpensiveItemName to find the name of the highest-priced item in the shopping cart .

The function should do the following:

Accept an array of items as its argument
Return the name of the most expensive item, as a string
As shown in the example shopping cart data below, the shopping cart is an array of items. Each item is an object with keys itemName, type, and price.

Your function mostExpensiveItemName should find the highest-priced item in the cart and return its itemName.

For example, passing in the sample array items, your function should return "Creation 3005".

mostExpensiveItemName(items) //=> "Creation 3005"
Note: If there are no items in the array passed in, your mostExpensiveItemName should return undefined.

Example shopping cart data
let items = [
  {
    itemName: "Effective Programming Habits",
    type: "book",
    price: 13.99
  },
  {
    itemName: "Creation 3005",
    type: "computer",
    price: 299.99
  },
  {
    itemName: "Finding Your Center",
    type: "book",
    price: 15.00
  }
]
Note: The tests will pass different arrays into your functionâ€”not just this one. The arrays will be like this one. Each item will be an object with the keys itemName, type, and price.
