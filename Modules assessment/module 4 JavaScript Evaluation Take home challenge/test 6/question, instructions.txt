Take-home: Science questions
Part 2: Filter answers by type
In this four-part challenge, you'll write functions to grade students' answers to a science quiz.

This is part 2. In this challenge, you'll write a function to filter the answers by the type of question.

Read these instructions.
Write the code to solve this challenge.
Run the tests to check your answer.
After your code passes the tests, move to the next challenge.
Instructions
Write a function named filterAnswersByType that does the following:

Takes in an array of student answers
Returns an array of the answers that have isEssayQuestion set to true
Using the example answers below,

filterAnswersByType(answers); /*=>
  [
    {
    question: 'What are lysosomes?',
    response: 'A lysosome is a membrane-bound organelle found in many animal cells. They are spherical vesicles that contain hydrolytic enzymes that can break down many kinds of biomolecules.',
    isCorrect: true,
    isEssayQuestion: true
  }
  ]
*/
If none of the answers are essay questions, return an empty array.

Example quiz data
A student's answers to a quiz are represented as an array.

let answers = [
  {
    question: 'What is the phase where chromosomes line up in mitosis?',
    response: 'Metaphase',
    isCorrect: true,
    isEssayQuestion: false
  },
  {
    question: 'What anatomical structure connects the stomach to the mouth?',
    response: 'Esophagus',
    isCorrect: true,
    isEssayQuestion: false
  },
  {
    question: 'What are lysosomes?',
    response: 'A lysosome is a membrane-bound organelle found in many animal cells. They are spherical vesicles that contain hydrolytic enzymes that can break down many kinds of biomolecules.',
    isCorrect: true,
    isEssayQuestion: true
  },
  {
    question: 'True or False: Prostaglandins can only constrict blood vessels.',
    response: 'True',
    isCorrect: false,
    isEssayQuestion: false
  }
];
Note: The tests will pass different arrays into your functionâ€”not just this one. The arrays will be like this one. Each item will be an object with the keys question, response, isCorrect, and isEssayQuestion.
