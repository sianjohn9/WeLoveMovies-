Take-home: School shopping
Part 3: Price lookup
This is part 3. In this challenge, you'll write a function to find the price of an item in a shopping cart, given a name.

Read these instructions.
Write the code to solve this challenge.
Run the tests to check your answer.
After your code passes the tests, move to the next challenge.
Instructions
Create a function called priceLookup to find the price of a single item.

The function should do the following:

Take in two arguments: an array of items and an item name as a string
Return the price (as a number) of the item with that name
For example, using the sample items array below:

priceLookup(items, "Effective Programming Habits") //=> 13.99
As shown in the example shopping cart data below, the shopping cart is an array of items. Each item is an object with keys itemName, type, and price.

Notes
If there are no items that match the name passed in, your priceLookup function should return undefined.
If there is more than one item in the array that matches the name, your function priceLookup should return the price of the first one that matches.
Example shopping cart data
let items = [
  {
    itemName: "Effective Programming Habits",
    type: "book",
    price: 13.99
  },
  {
    itemName: "Creation 3005",
    type: "computer",
    price: 299.99
  },
  {
    itemName: "Finding Your Center",
    type: "book",
    price: 15.00
  }
]
Note: The tests will pass different arrays into your functionâ€”not just this one. The arrays will be like this one. Each item will be an object with the keys itemName, type, and price.
