Take-home: Science questions
Part 3: Find student's answer to a question
In this four-part challenge, you'll write functions to grade students' answers to a science quiz.

This is part 3. In this challenge, you'll write a function to find the student's answer to a particular question.

Read these instructions.
Write the code to solve this challenge.
Run the tests to check your answer.
After your code passes the tests, move to the next challenge.
Instructions
Write a function named findAnswer that does the following:

Takes in two arguments: an array of student answers, and a string for the question to match
Returns the item in the array that matches that question
Using the example answers below,

findAnswer(answers, "True or False: Prostaglandins can only constrict blood vessels."); /*=>
  {
    question: 'True or False: Prostaglandins can only constrict blood vessels.',
    response: 'True',
    isCorrect: false,
    isEssayQuestion: false
  }
*/
Notes
If none of the student's answers match the question, return undefined.
If more than one of the students' answers match the question, return the first one in the array.
Example quiz data
A student's answers to a quiz are represented as an array.

let answers = [
  {
    question: 'What is the phase where chromosomes line up in mitosis?',
    response: 'Metaphase',
    isCorrect: true,
    isEssayQuestion: false
  },
  {
    question: 'What anatomical structure connects the stomach to the mouth?',
    response: 'Esophagus',
    isCorrect: true,
    isEssayQuestion: false
  },
  {
    question: 'What are lysosomes?',
    response: 'A lysosome is a membrane-bound organelle found in many animal cells. They are spherical vesicles that contain hydrolytic enzymes that can break down many kinds of biomolecules.',
    isCorrect: true,
    isEssayQuestion: true
  },
  {
    question: 'True or False: Prostaglandins can only constrict blood vessels.',
    response: 'True',
    isCorrect: false,
    isEssayQuestion: false
  }
];
Note: The tests will pass different arrays into your functionâ€”not just this one. The arrays will be like this one. Each item will be an object with the keys question, response, isCorrect, and isEssayQuestion.
