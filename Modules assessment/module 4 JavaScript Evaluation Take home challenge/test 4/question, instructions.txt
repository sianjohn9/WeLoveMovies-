Take-home: School shopping
Part 4: Filter by price
This the final challenge, part 4. In this challenge, you'll write a function to find all the items in a shopping cart that are below a given price.

Read these instructions.
Write the code to solve this challenge.
Run the tests to check your answer.
After your code passes the tests, move to the next challenge.
Instructions
Create a function called priceFilter that returns all the items whose price is under a certain amount.

The function should do the following:

Take in two arguments, an array of items and an amount (a number)
Return an array of items that have a price below the amount
For example, here's what the function should return when you pass in the sample items and the amount 50:

priceFilter(items, 50) //*   
[
  {
    itemName: "Effective Programming Habits",
    type: "book",
    price: 13.99
  }
  {
    itemName: "Finding Your Center",
    type: "book",
    price: 15.00
  }
]
*/
As shown in the example shopping cart data below, the shopping cart is an array of items. Each item is an object with keys itemName, type, and price.

Notes
If there are no items that have a price below the amount, your priceFilter function should return an empty array [].
Example shopping cart data
let items = [
  {
    itemName: "Effective Programming Habits",
    type: "book",
    price: 13.99
  },
  {
    itemName: "Creation 3005",
    type: "computer",
    price: 299.99
  },
  {
    itemName: "Finding Your Center",
    type: "book",
    price: 15.00
  }
]
Note: The tests will pass different arrays into your functionâ€”not just this one. The arrays will be like this one. Each item will be an object with the keys itemName, type, and price.
