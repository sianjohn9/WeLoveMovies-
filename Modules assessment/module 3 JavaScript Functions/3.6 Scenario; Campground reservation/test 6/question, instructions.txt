Campground reservations: Filter campsites by multiple criteria
Which campsites are available to reserve for my party and desired view?
The biggest feature that users have requested is findMyCampsites(). People want to know which campsites are available that have their desired view and can fit their party size.

Qualified challenge requirements
Write a function findMyCampsites().
Given a campgrounds array, a type of view as a string, and the party size as a number, return an array with campsite numbers for the matching campsites. That is, your function should return results that match the following three criteria:
     a. Currently available campsites (`isReserved === false`) 
     b. With the view that matches the input string (such as `ocean` or `forest`) 
     c. That can host the party size of the input number, or greater 
If no sites are available, return the string 'Sorry, no campsites with that view are available to host your party'
Here's an example:


//example input/output 

findMyCampsites(campgrounds, "ocean", 4); //-> [1, 5] 

findMyCampsites(campgrounds, "ocean", 8); //-> [1] 

findMyCampsites(campgrounds, "forest", 4); //-> [18] 

findMyCampsites(campgrounds, "forest", 6); //-> 'Sorry, no campsites with that view are available to host your party'
Array
Our data looks like this. It's an array with a bunch of campsite objects in it. Here is a small subset of the data to give you an idea:


let campgrounds = [ 

  { number: 1, view: "ocean", partySize: 8, isReserved: false }, 

  { number: 5, view: "ocean", partySize: 4, isReserved: false }, 

  { number: 12, view: "ocean", partySize: 4, isReserved: true }, 

  { number: 18, view: "forest", partySize: 4, isReserved: false }, 

  { number: 23, view: "forest", partySize: 4, isReserved: true },
