Congratulations on successfully completing the last challenge! Let's keep going.

Campsite reservations: Max capacity
How many people can we host at max capacity?
As our popularity increases, our reservation website needs to calculate our maximum capacity.

Qualified challenge requirements
Write a function called campgroundCapacity(campgrounds) that takes a collection of campgrounds like the array shown below.
Given a campgrounds array, return the total number of people the campground can host.
If all sites are filled to maximum capacity, - call the function campgroundCapacity(campgrounds).
Array
Our data looks like this. It's an array with a bunch of campsite objects in it. Here is a small subset of the data to give you an idea:


const campgrounds = [ 

  { number: 1, view: "ocean", partySize: 8, isReserved: false }, 

  { number: 5, view: "ocean", partySize: 4, isReserved: false }, 

  { number: 12, view: "ocean", partySize: 4, isReserved: true }, 

  { number: 18, view: "forest", partySize: 4, isReserved: false }, 

  { number: 23, view: "forest", partySize: 4, isReserved: true }, 

];
The campgroundCapacity(campgrounds) function should return 24 if the campgrounds array shown above is used.
