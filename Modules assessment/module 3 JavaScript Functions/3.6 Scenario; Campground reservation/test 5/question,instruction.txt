Just two more functions left. Keep it up! You're doing great.

Campground reservations: Count campsites by type of view
How many campsites are there with each kind of view?
We need to know how many campsites we have with each kind of view, regardless of whether or not they are currently reserved.

Qualified challenge requirements
Write a function called countByView() that takes two arguments:
a. An array of campsites
b. A string, such as 'ocean' or 'forest', for the view type
Given a campgrounds array, return the total number of campsites with the view matching the input string, regardless of whether or not the campsites are currently reserved.
Here's an example:

countByView(campgrounds, "ocean"); //-> 3 

countByView(campgrounds, "forest"); // -> 2
Array
Our data looks like this. It's an array with a bunch of campsite objects in it. Here is a small subset of the data to give you an idea:


let campgrounds = [ 

  { number: 1, view: "ocean", partySize: 8, isReserved: false }, 

  { number: 5, view: "ocean", partySize: 4, isReserved: false }, 

  { number: 12, view: "ocean", partySize: 4, isReserved: true }, 

  { number: 18, view: "forest", partySize: 4, isReserved: false }, 

  { number: 23, view: "forest", partySize: 4, isReserved: true }, 

];
