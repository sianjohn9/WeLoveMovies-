Challenge: How many candy types are in the array?
We want to know how many candy types we have in the inventory.

Create a function called countCandyTypes that takes in the inventory array.

Return the number of objects in the array, which should be the number of types of candy.

Example input and output
countCandyTypes(inventory); //-> 4
countCandyTypes([]) //-> 0
Sample inventory array
This is a sample of the data that will be used in all of the challenges.

let inventory = [
  { candy: "Twizzlers", inStock: 180, weeklyAverage: 200 },
  { candy: "Sour Patch Kids", inStock: 90, weeklyAverage: 100 },
  { candy: "Milk Duds", inStock: 300, weeklyAverage: 170 },
  { candy: "Now and Laters", inStock: 150, weeklyAverage: 40 }
];
The tests might pass in different inventory arrays, but they'll have the same shape.
