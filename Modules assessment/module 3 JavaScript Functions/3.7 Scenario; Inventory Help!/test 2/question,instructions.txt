Challenge: How many candies are in stock?
We want to know how many units we have in total (all candies). Create a function called totalInStock that takes in:

the inventory array
Add up the inStock value from each candy.

Return the total number of candies in stock.

Example input and output
totalInStock([]) //-> 0
totalInStock(inventory); //-> 720
Sample inventory array
This is a sample of the data that will be used in all of the challenges.

let inventory = [
  { candy: "Twizzlers", inStock: 180, weeklyAverage: 200 },
  { candy: "Sour Patch Kids", inStock: 90, weeklyAverage: 100 },
  { candy: "Milk Duds", inStock: 300, weeklyAverage: 170 },
  { candy: "Now and Laters", inStock: 150, weeklyAverage: 40 }
];
The tests might pass in different inventory arrays, but they'll have the same shape.
